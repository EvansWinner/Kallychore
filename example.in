SHNOTEBOOK.SH --- Mix plain text with shell command output

This is an example of a file that uses 'shnotebook.sh' for processing.
It is a regular text file with shell commands preceded with hash-mark
comment characters ("#").  When this file is processed with
'shnotebook.sh' lines which are normal text should be simply echoed to
standard output, but lines which are preceded with a comment character
will be executed and replaced by their output to standard output. For
example, the next line is a call to 'wc' to list the number of
characters in this file:

## This comment with double-comment characters will not print in the
## final result.

# wc -m shnotebook.sh

You can duplicate (annoying, I know) your call in advance, and wrap
the output in some cute ASCII art, if you think it makes it nicer. Try
piping a command to sed 's/^/  /' to indent it a couple of spaces if
you like that:

$ wc -m shnotebook.sh
,----------
# wc -m shnotebook.sh | sed 's/^/  /'
\`--------- 


REQUIREMENTS

'shnotebook.sh' requires bash, cat, and sed in your path. That should be
all.

Use it like this:

  shnotebook.sh file.txt

Use whatever file extension you like for the input file. The results
will go to standard output, so redirect to a file if you want to save
it, like --

  shnotebook.sh inputfile.txt > finalresult.txt

Now we will be the envy of all those poor schlubs who are using
Rmarkdown and all that silly nonsense. Plain text forever!

Notes:

Don't use back-ticks. I don't know why. Just don't. Everything you
think should just be an easy, quick little hack has to get
complicated....
