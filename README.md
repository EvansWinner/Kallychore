# SHNOTEBOOK.SH 

shnotebook.sh is a gutter-punk version of a data science notebook,
using bash. It takes a plain text file as input and sends it back to
standard output, more or less.

Lines beginning with # are evaluated in bash and replaced by their
output. That's about it. See example.in and example.out for more
insight.
