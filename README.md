# KALLYCHORE.SH 

kallychore.sh is a gutter-punk version of a data science notebook,
using bash for plain text command line use. It takes a plain text file
as input and sends it back to standard output, with lines beginning
with # evaluated in bash and replaced by their output. That's about
it. See example.in and example.out for more insight.
