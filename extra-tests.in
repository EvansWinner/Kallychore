# This is a title

~README.in~ is the main test file for Kallychore, but I want to be
able to test a few more things. The file starts and ends with a code
cell. This file also is intended to be used with Pandoc to see if
Pandoc stuff works.

{{{
echo "It worked!"

In html output, the string above, "It worked!" should be in some kind
of monospace block.

{{{
echo "Ta-da!"
