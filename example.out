KALLYCHORE.SH --- Mix plain text with shell command output

This is an example of a file that uses 'kallychore.sh'[1] for
processing.  It is a regular text file with shell commands preceded
with hash-mark comment characters ("#").  When this file is processed
with 'kallychore.sh' lines which are normal text should be simply
echoed to standard output, but lines which are preceded with a comment
character will be executed and replaced by their output to standard
output. For example, the next line is a call to 'wc' to list the
number of characters in the script file 'kallychore.sh':


310 kallychore.sh

You can duplicate (annoying, I know) your call in advance, and wrap
the output in some cute ASCII art, if you think it makes it nicer. Try
piping a command to sed 's/^/  /' to indent it a couple of spaces if
you like that:

$ wc -m kallychore.sh
,----------
  310 kallychore.sh
`---------- 

Here are some more examples:

How many times bigger are all the files in this directory put together
than this file by itself? (An Earth-shaking question if ever there was
one.)

$ echo $(( `wc -m example.in | awk '{print $1}'` / `wc -m * | awk '{print $1}' | tail -1` ))
,----------
`----------

Another example:

First, make data file showing the character counts of all the files in
this directory:

$ wc -c * | awk '{print }' | head -5 | awk 'BEGIN {i=1}; {print i " " bash; i++}' > data.dat


Then, I don't know, plot it, I guess:

$ gnuplot -e "set terminal dumb; plot 'data.dat'"

REQUIREMENTS

'kallychore.sh' requires bash, cat, and sed in your path. That should be
all.


USE

Use it like this:

  kallychore.sh file.txt

Use whatever file extension you like for the input file. The results
will go to standard output, so redirect to a file if you want to save
it, like --

  kallychore.sh inputfile.txt > finalresult.txt

Now we will be the envy of all those poor schlubs who are using
Rmarkdown and all that silly nonsense. Plain text forever!

NOTES

Don't use back-ticks. Or dollar signs. I don't know why. Just
don't. Or use them, but escape them in your source file. I don't know
how to escape them in'echo'. Everything you think should just be an
easy, quick little hack has to get complicated....

You could write the plain text part of your document any way you
want. You could write it in Markdown, for instance, and pipe it into
some Markdown processor. Whatever. It's a free country.

Everything gets piped to a single instance of bash, so variables
should carry over from one "cell" to another; and multi-line things
should work.

This is a kind of a proof of concept. Tell me what doesn't work and
I'll think about fixing it.
